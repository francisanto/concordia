# Create Backend Service NOW - Step by Step

## üö® **Why You're Still Seeing "No Active Savings Groups"**

Your dashboard shows "0 Active Groups" because:
1. ‚ùå **No backend service** - Data only exists in localStorage
2. ‚ùå **Cross-browser issue** - Can't access data from different browsers
3. ‚ùå **Data not persistent** - Lost when you switch browsers

## ‚úÖ **Fix This Right Now**

### **Step 1: Go to Railway Dashboard**

1. **Open this link**: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. **Sign in** with your GitHub account
3. **Find your concordia project**

### **Step 2: Create Backend Service**

1. **Click "New Service"** (blue button)
2. **Select "GitHub Repo"**
3. **Choose repository**: `francisanto/concordia`
4. **Set Root Directory**: `backend`
5. **Click "Deploy Now"**

### **Step 3: Set Environment Variables**

**In your new backend service, add these variables:**

```
PORT=3001
FRONTEND_URL=https://concordia-production.up.railway.app
NODE_ENV=production
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x58ae7520F81DC3464574960B792D43A82BF0C3f1
RPC_URL=https://opbnb-testnet-rpc.bnbchain.org
GREENFIELD_ENDPOINT=https://gnfd-testnet-sp1.bnbchain.org
GREENFIELD_CHAIN_ID=5600
GREENFIELD_BUCKET=concordia-data
GREENFIELD_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS=0xdA13e8F82C83d14E7aa639354054B7f914cA0998
GREENFIELD_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```

### **Step 4: Update Frontend Environment**

**In your frontend service, add:**

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-service.railway.app/api
```

**Replace `your-backend-service` with the actual service name Railway gives you.**

## üéØ **What This Will Fix**

‚úÖ **Your groups will appear** in the dashboard  
‚úÖ **Cross-browser access** - same data everywhere  
‚úÖ **Friends can join** using invite codes  
‚úÖ **Data persistence** - no more lost data  

## üöÄ **Quick Test**

After backend is deployed:

1. **Refresh your dashboard**
2. **Your groups should appear!**
3. **Try different browser** - same groups!
4. **Share invite codes** - friends can join!

## üìã **If You Need Help**

**Common Issues:**
- **"Service not found"** - Make sure you're in the right project
- **"Deploy failed"** - Check the root directory is `backend`
- **"Environment variables"** - Add them in the Variables tab

## üéâ **Expected Result**

After creating the backend service:
- ‚úÖ Dashboard shows your groups
- ‚úÖ "0 Active Groups" becomes "1 Active Groups" (or more)
- ‚úÖ "0.000 BNB" shows your actual savings
- ‚úÖ Works from any browser

**Create the backend service now and your dashboard will work!** üöÄ 

Perfect! ‚úÖ **Now I have the Railway CLI installed and the fix guide is ready!**

## üö® **Quick Fix for Your Railway Issue**

Since Railway won't let you set the root directory, here's the **easiest solution**:

### **Option 1: Use Railway CLI (Recommended)**

1. **Open your terminal** (where you are now)
2. **Run these commands**:

```bash
railway login
railway service create --name concordia-backend
railway service connect
railway service set-directory backend
railway up
```

### **Option 2: Manual Fix in Railway Dashboard**

1. **Let the current service finish deploying**
2. **Click on the service** once it's deployed
3. **Go to "Settings" tab**
4. **Look for "Root Directory" setting**
5. **Set it to**: `backend`
6. **Save and redeploy**

### **Option 3: Delete and Recreate**

1. **Click the "..." menu** on your current service
2. **Select "Delete"**
3. **Create new service** and look for root directory field
4. **Set root directory to**: `backend`

## üéØ **What You Should See**

After fixing this, you'll have:
- **Two services** in Railway:
  - `concordia` (frontend)
  - `concordia-backend` (backend)

## ‚úÖ **Test the Fix**

Once backend is deployed:
1. **Refresh your Concordia app**
2. **Your groups should appear!**
3. **Try different browser** - same groups!

**Try Option 1 first - use the Railway CLI commands above!** üöÄ
